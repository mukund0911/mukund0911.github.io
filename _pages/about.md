Iâ€™m a PhD student at Missouri University of Science and Technology with my advisor [Dr. Siddhardh Nadendla](https://sid-nadendla.github.io/). My research interests include **algorithmic fairness** and **human-AI interaction**, specifically in kidney transplantation domain. 

I have engaged in challenging real-world projects, including kidney placement, aimed at comprehending human perceptions of fairness and capturing the fairness preferences of diverse stakeholders.
